# sleeptimegrt-skills — agent map

Reusable, domain-neutral agent skills for engineering harness work across repositories.
This repo's skills are modeled on general-purpose, cross-tool skill collections like
[obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) and
[mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills).

This repo is meant to hold skills shared across the coding agents the user runs
day to day: Claude Code, Codex, and Antigravity. Every skill under `skills/` is
authored as a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name` + `description`) and
progressive disclosure. Confirmed 2026-07-22 (see
[vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) and the
[Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io)): this format is cross-tool as-is —
Claude Code, Codex, and Antigravity (and 70+ other agents) all consume the same
`SKILL.md` without conversion via the `npx skills` installer. The one caveat:
some frontmatter features are Claude-Code-only (`allowed-tools` behavior
details, `context: fork`, hooks) — avoid depending on those in a skill meant to
be portable. See issue #2 for the installer-adoption discussion (catalog vs.
flat layout, publishing this repo via `npx skills add`, plugin-marketplace
distribution).

## Fresh agent protocol

1. Read this file.
2. Read `HANDOFF.md` when it exists; it contains the current work state and verified evidence.
3. For skill creation or substantial skill changes, use the `skill-creator` skill before editing. Note: it's a
   Claude Code skill, so its packaging advice may not be tuned for Codex/Antigravity — sanity-check anything
   Claude-Code-specific it suggests against the cross-tool goal above.
4. Load only the target skill and the resources directly required for the task.

## Gate-output design constraints

For skills that inspect or modify hooks, verify commands, CI, shell scripts, or package scripts:

- Distinguish non-interactive gates from interactive development, deploy, migration, and destructive commands.
- Compact only non-interactive gate output by default. Do not silence interactive progress indiscriminately.
- Preserve `PASS`, `WARN`, `FAIL`, and `SKIP` as distinct outcomes.
- Preserve the original exit code, signal behavior, command order, and fail-fast semantics.
- Keep full diagnostics discoverable through bounded, untracked, worktree-safe logs.
- Treat persisted logs as sensitive assets: use restrictive permissions and review commands for secret output.
- Prefer progressive disclosure: summary first, then targeted `rg`, `tail`, or stage-specific log reads.

## Validation

- Test scripts against temporary fixture repositories before using them on real repositories.
- Cover success, warning, failure, spaces in paths, interrupted execution, worktrees, and log cleanup.
- Compare the gate stages before and after a change so output refactoring cannot silently remove verification.
- Run representative pilots before extracting a shared abstraction or applying changes across repositories.

## Repository operations

- Do not run deploy, release, migration, seed, wipe, or other external-write commands merely to measure output.
- Keep changes to different target repositories in independent commits.
